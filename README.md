# Experimental Command-Line interface for CryptPad

The goal is to create a node JS program exposing a shell UI to the user with the following commands:

- help (very difficult command telling you the commands available)
- ls (showing the pads and folders from the current folder)
- cd (switch to a different folder, including a shared folder)
- info (display info about a pad or folder)
- cat (display the content of a pad)
- mv (move a pad to another folder, rename a pad or folder)
- rename <old> <new>  Rename folder
- download <name> [path] Download pad to local file
- create <type> <title> Create new pad
- clear               Clear the screen
- exit                Exit the shell
